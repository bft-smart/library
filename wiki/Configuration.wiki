=How to configure BFT-SMaRt replicas=
The parameters to configure BFT-SMaRt replicas are stored in two files: hosts.config and system.config.
To comment out a configuration parameter in those files, the line must start with the character #.

==hosts.config==

The address and port of all replicas must be specified in this file.
The number or replicas must be the same as defined in the property {{{system.servers.num}}} of system.config.

==system.config==

In this file there are several options to configure the replication protocol, number or replicas, timeouts and others. These parameters are described below:

|| *Parameter* || *Description* || * Values * || *Default value* ||
|| {{{system.communicatin.useSenderThread}}} || Specify if the communication system should use a thread to send data || true or false || true ||
|| {{{system.servers.num}}} || Number of servers in the system || integer || 4 ||
|| {{{system.servers.f}}} || Maximum number of faulty replicas supported || integer || 1 ||
|| {{{system.totalordermulticast.timeout}}} || Time that a replica waits for the propose of a request. If the request is not proposed by the leader within the interval defined, the replica invokes the leader change protocol || integer (milliseconds) || 10000 ||
|| {{{system.totalordermulticast.highMark}}} || Maximum ahead-of-time message not discarded. When a replica is delayed it stores the consensus in an out-of-context queue.\n If the number of consensus to be processed is above the value defined in this parameter, the replicas discard the messages and invoke the state transfer protocol || integer || 10000 ||
|| {{{system.totalordermulticast.maxtachsize}}} || Maximun number of messages to be included in a single propose message || integer || 400 ||
|| {{{system.total.ordermulticast.nonces}}} || Number of nonces (for non-determinism actions) generated || integer || 0 ||
|| {{{system.communication.inQueueSize}}} || Number of messages that can be stored in the receive queue of the communication system || integer || 100000 ||
|| {{{system.communication.outQueueSize}}} || Number of messages taht can be stored in the send queue of each replica || integer || 100000 ||
|| {{{system.communication.useSignatures}}} || Used to define if clients should use signatures for MAC vectors || 0 or 1 || 0 ||
|| {{{system.communication.useMACs}}} || Used for communication between the replicas. It defines if replicas should use authentication channels among them || 0 or 1 || 0 ||
|| {{{system.totalordermulticast.state_transfer}}} || Activate the state transfer protocol || true or false || true ||
|| system.totalordermulticast.checkpoint_period || Period at which the replica asks the state from the application and clear the log. Used to record a checkpoint and bound the size of the log. This number is the count of consensuns messages processed || integer || 50 ||
|| {{{system.totalordermulticast.revival_highMark}}} || Maximum ahead-of-time message not discarded when the replica is still on EID 0 (after which the state transfer is triggered). In practice this is used for a replica to verify if it crashed and was revived || integer || 10 ||
|| {{{system.initial.view}}} || Replicas IDs for the initial view, separated by comma. The number of replicas in this parameter should be equal to the one specified in {{{system.servers.num}}} || integer, || 0,1,2,3 ||
|| {{{system.ttp.id}}} || The ID of the trusted third party (TTP). The TTP is used to add and remove replicas to the system || integer || 7002 ||
|| {{{system.bft}}} || This sets if the system will function in Byzantine or crash-only mode. Set to "true" to support Byzantine faults. || boolean || true ||

==Public keys==

If you need to generate public/private keys for replicas or clients, you can use the following command to generate files for public and private keys:

{{{./smartrun.sh bftsmart.tom.util.RSAKeyPairGenerator <id of the replica/client>}}}

Keys are stored in the config/keys folder. The command above creates key pairs both for clients and replicas. Currently such keys need to be manually distributed.
